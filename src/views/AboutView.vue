    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      I am Marin Vujica, I am 25 year old Croatian. At the moment I study Multimedia Design at Erhvervsakademi SydVest in Esbjerg.
I have a lot of work experiences in various areas in different countries. With my curious personality, I’m open to try myself in new environments and do something new and grow along the way. I’m a quick learner and I can addapt to any environment because of my ability to have a good comunnication with people and my social personality. Along the way I have learned to be responsible and do my best for any company I worked at that moment. To push myself outside of my comfort zone & grow as a human being while doing my best. I look forward for a new job opportunity in Graphic Design area as a young student here in Esbjerg, best regards!
